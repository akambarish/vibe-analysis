* Records analysed: 979 films

## Key findings
- **Westerns quietly dominate ratings.** The genre averages 8.26 across just 9 titles, far outpacing more saturated categories.
- **History titles deliver impact in minimal time.** The lone entry runs 66 minutes yet still posts a 8.0 rating, signalling an underexplored format.
- **Runtime and reception move together.** Across the sample, runtime and rating show a Pearson correlation of 0.23, indicating longer stories earn modestly higher scores.
- **Actor efficiency reveals hidden standouts.** Mark Hamill averages 8.63 from 3 appearances, the strongest record among performers with at least three films.
- **Epic runtimes still resonate.** The longest film in the set, Hamlet (242 minutes), holds an IMDb rating of 7.8.
